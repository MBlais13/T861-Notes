can only use double Collin once- not twice
representing zeros

example:
```
::1
fe80::94de:13ff:fef2:50a7/64
```

double colon represents all zeros

Number of ipv6 addresses 10^38

Dual stack: devices that run ipv6 and ipv4 simultaneously

tunnelling: a method of transporting ipv6 packet over ipv4
Translation network translation address


**Ip addressing formats**
128bits address length
x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x

`00ab` can be written as `ab`
Leading 0â€™s can be removed but not from the end


Ipv6 does not have a broadcast address
Unicast, multicast and anycast

Anycast is a ipv6 address and can be assigned to multiple devices.
