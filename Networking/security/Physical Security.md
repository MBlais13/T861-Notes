#security

If network resources can be physically compromised, a threat actor can deny the use of network resources. The four classes of physical threats are as follows:

* Hardware threats
	This includes physical damage to servers, routers, switches, cabling plant, and workstations.

* Environmental threats
	This includes temperature extremes (too hot or too cold) or humidity extremes (too wet or too dry).

* Electrical threats
	This includes voltage spikes, insufficient supply voltage (brownouts), unconditioned power (noise), and total power loss.

* Maintenance threats
	This includes poor handling of key electrical components (electrostatic discharge), lack of critical spare parts, poor cabling, and poor labeling.

A good plan for physical security must be created and implemented to address these issues.Â
