Access attacks exploit known vulnerabilities in authentication services, FTP services, and web services to gain entry to web accounts, confidential databases, and other sensitive information.

Access attacks can be classified into four types:

* Password attacks
	Implemented using brute force, trojan horse, and packet sniffers

* Trust exploitation
	A threat actor uses unauthorized privileges to gain access to a system, possibly compromising the target.

* Port redirection:
	A threat actor uses a compromised system as a base for attacks against other targets. For example, a threat actor using SSH (port 22) to connect to a compromised host A. Host A is trusted by host B and, therefore, the threat actor can use Telnet (port 23) to access it.

* Man-in-the middle
	The threat actor is positioned in between two legitimate entities in order to read or modify the data that passes between the two parties.
