Variations of phishing attacks are:
•	**Spear Phishing**: This is a highly targeted phishing attack. Spear phishing focuses on a specific individual or organization.

•	**Whaling**: This is a type of spear phishing, but the target is even more specific – high-profile individuals, such as CEOs, CFOs, or other executives.  The goal is to gain access to sensitive company information or financial assets. The attacks are highly sophisticated and often involve extensive research and social engineering tactics.

•	**Vishing**:  This is a voice-based phishing attack.  Attackers impersonate legitimate organizations (banks, credit card companies, etc) over the phone to trick victims into revealing sensitive information, such as account numbers, passwords, or credit card details.  They might use caller ID spoofing to make it appear as if the call is coming from a trusted source.

•	**Smishing**:  This is a phishing attack conducted via SMS text messages.These messages often claim to be from legitimate organizations or services, urging immediate action to create a sense of urgency.
