Peppering & salting

- Salting and peppering are security techniques used to strengthen password storage against attacks like brute force and rainbow table attacks.

Salting involves adding a unique, random string (called a salt) to each user’s password before hashing it. This ensures that even if two users have the same password, their hashes will be different.

Peppering involves adding a secret, fixed value (called a pepper) to passwords before hashing. Unlike salts, peppers are not stored in the database—instead, they are kept secret, typically in application code or environment variables.
