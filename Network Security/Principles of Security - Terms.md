	- Difficulty patching firmware
	- legacy platforms
	- end-of-life
- Misconfigurations
	- settings are not implemented properly
- Zero-day

- Data exfiltration
	- stealing data to distribute to other parties
- Data breach
	- stealing data to disclose to other parties
- Identity theft
	- taking personal information to impersonate someone
